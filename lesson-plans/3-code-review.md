# Code Review

Code Quality! Code Review!

You will learn how to use automated tools to check your own code's quality, and
a check-list to review each other's code:

- **Generated Documentation**: Use
  [jsdoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown/) to convert
  your JSDoc comments into markdown documentation in a README file.
- **Testing**: Use unit tests to show that your code does what you think it
  does.
- **Formatting**: Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format your code,
  making sure that all the code in your group's repository is formatted the same
  way and is easy to read.
- **Linting**: Just because your code runs doesn't mean it's good! Use
  [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to make sure that everyone's code is easy to
  read, avoids common mistakes, and uses a consistent style. Linting will be the
  trickiest thing to get used to, it's basically a loud voice saying "_NO!_" to
  all sorts of things in your code. But it's for your own good, linting makes it
  easier to write quality code and to collaborate on a group exercise.
- **Code Review**: Not everything can be automated, you will also learn how to
  review each other's code.

Clone the
[practice-code-review](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/bf-practice-code-review)
repository and spend some time studying the example solution. You will want to:

- install the repository dependencies
- practice running the solution and the tests
- practice running the code quality scripts
